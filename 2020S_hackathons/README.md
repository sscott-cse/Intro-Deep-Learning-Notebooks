## Summer 2023 CSE 479/879 Hackathons

Welcome! This page will host all the hackathons for the Summer 2023 term. This readme will guide you through getting the Hackathons up and running. Please ask me if you've got any questions or suggestions, and I hope you have a great semester.

### How to Get Started

You can upload the file by downloading from GitHub (click to open the file > click the "raw" button in the upper-right > right click and hit save)

To upload a file to Swan
1. Navigate to [swan-ood.unl.edu](https://swan-ood.unl.edu/)
2. In the top drop-down, click the "Files" dropdown and select the "Home Directory" button
3. In the upper right of the page showing the files, click the "Upload" model and use the dialog popup to upload the file.

### How to Run Hackathons in Jupyter

You can upload each notebook to Crane and run/edit it as you like. Make sure you set the kernel to `Python CSE479 (tensorflow-env)` or to your custom kernel. Each hackathon has a homework at the bottom which you should submit to Canvas by the deadline indicated on the Canvas assignment.

Let us know by email, in office hours, or on Piazza if you run into any problems.

### Running Outside of Notebooks
To use the environment outside of a Jupyter notebook, you can ssh into Swan and run:
```bash
module load anaconda
conda activate tensorflow-env
```
