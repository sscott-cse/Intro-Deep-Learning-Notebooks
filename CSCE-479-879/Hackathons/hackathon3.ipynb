We want to keep training until improvement stops, but because neural networks are non-linear, they might get worse before they get better, so we don't want to stop them after getting worse one time. We'll use the following code to do \"early stopping\" with patience. We pass in the validation loss (Note: make sure you use validation loss, not training loss. This is important) and `check` will tell us whether we should stop. It will return `True` after the loss hasn't improved for `patience` epochs.\n",

Think about the question posed above about dropout: \"Why isn't the difference between the number of zeros before and after applying dropout exactly equal to the dropout proportion?\" Consider the network architecture and what operations were run before the dropout layer. Write a few sentences about this in the same text file as the previous question and submit to Canvas.\n",

If you don't understand how to do any part of this or if it's taking you longer than that, please let me know in office hours or by email (both can be found on the syllabus). I'm also happy to discuss if you just want to ask more questions about anything in this notebook!"
